# search-youtube-subtitle-chrome-extension
This is a simple chrome extension to search for a text in a youtube subtitle

It works well by now, only issue I have to use Manifest V2, since V3 doesn't support script always running on background, and on V3, webRequest doesn't wake up the service worker
